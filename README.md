# curr issues

2/8/26 - lichess embed iframes being funky with strict browser settings so to have moves actually work within the embed i'll probably need to use chessboard.js

2/9/26 -
chessboard.js/chess.min.js/jquery.min.js integration successful
just needed to convert UCI notation from lichess API to PGN :D
thanks to the wonderful people below for making such an easy-to-use standalone board!

# next steps:

get on chrome web store :pray:
make sure stats persist/no weird behavior in puzzles
actually have cool videos to watch in the embed
